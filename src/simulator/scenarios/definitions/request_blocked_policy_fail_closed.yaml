  Control-plane request validation fails due to policy engine runtime exception, but the system is fail-closed:
  root has gentoro.request.outcome=blocked, gentoro.block.reason=request_policy, gentoro.policy.fail_mode=closed; the
  policy span has status=ERROR, gentoro.policy.decision=block, gentoro.policy.reason=engine_error, gentoro.policy.severity=high,
  and an exception event (PolicyEngineTimeout).
