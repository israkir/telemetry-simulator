# Agent calls new_claim (correct tool) with incorrect or missing parameters → 4xx.
# Cause: how input entities were specified — e.g. date of loss in wrong format (13/31/2024,
# "March 15" vs ISO), missing required fields, or malformed payload. One MCP attempt gets
# error.type=invalid_arguments and http.response.status_code in [400, 404, 422].
# Division: electronics (TV, laptop, home electronics). Template-driven; no code change to add similar scenarios.

  Agent calls new_claim for electronics with wrong format or missing parameters (e.g. date format,
  missing required field), resulting in 4xx. Cause: how input entities were specified by the user.
